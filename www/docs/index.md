# Process Compose ðŸ”¥

Process Compose is a simple and flexible scheduler and orchestrator to manage non-containerized applications.

## Why was it made?

Because sometimes you just don't want to deal with docker files, volume definitions, networks and docker registries.
Since it's written in Go, Process Compose is a single binary file and has no other dependencies.

Once [installed](installation.md), you just need to describe your workflow using a simple [YAML](http://yaml.org/) schema in a file called `process-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
version: "0.5"

processes:
  hello:
    command: echo 'Hello World from Process Compose'
```

And start it by running `process-compose up` from your terminal.

Check the [Documentation](launcher.md) for more advanced use cases.
