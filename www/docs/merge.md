Using multiple `process-compose` files lets you customize a `process-compose` application for different environments or different workflows.

### Understanding multiple Compose files

By default, `process-compose` reads two files, a `process-compose.yml` and an optional `process-compose.override.yml` file. By convention, the `process-compose.yml` contains your base configuration. The override file, as its name implies, can contain configuration overrides for existing processes or entirely new processes.

If a process is defined in both files, `process-compose` merges the configurations using the rules described in [Adding and overriding configuration](#adding-and-overriding-configuration).

To use multiple override files, or an override file with a different name, you can use the `-f` option to specify the list of files. `process-compose` merges files in the order theyâ€™re specified on the command line. 

When you use multiple configuration files, you must make sure all paths in the files are relative to the base `process-compose` file (the first `process-compose` file specified with `-f`). This is required because override files need not be valid `process-compose` files. Override files can contain small fragments of configuration. Tracking which fragment of a process is relative to which path is difficult and confusing, so to keep paths easier to understand, all paths must be defined relative to the base file.

### Example use case

#### Different environments

A common use case for multiple files is changing a development `process-compose` app for a production-like environment (which may be production, staging or CI). To support these differences, you can split your `process-compose` configuration into a few different files:

Start with a base file that defines the canonical configuration for the processes.

**process-compose.yml**

```yaml
processes:
  web:
    command: "npm start"
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: process_started
      cache:
        condition: process_started

  db:
    command: "pg_ctl start -l logfile"

  cache:
    command: "systemctl start redis"
```

In this example the development configuration adds debug flags.

**process-compose.override.yml**

```yaml
processes:
  web:
    environment:
      - "DEBUG=true"

  db:
    command: "pg_ctl start -l logfile -d"

```

When you run `process-compose` it reads the overrides automatically.

Now, it would be nice to use this `process-compose` app in a production environment. So, create another override file (which might be stored in a different git repo or managed by a different team).

**process-compose.prod.yml**

```yaml
processes:
  web:
    environment:
      - "PRODUCTION=true"

  cache:
    environment:
      - "TTL=500"
```

To deploy with this production `process-compose` file you can run

```shell
$ process-compose -f process-compose.yml -f process-compose.prod.yml
```

This deploys all three processes using the configuration in `process-compose.yml` and `process-compose.prod.yml` (but not the dev configuration in `process-compose.override.yml`).

### Adding and overriding configuration

`process-compose` copies configurations from the original process over to the local one. If a configuration option is defined in both the original process and the local process, the local value *replaces* or *extends* the original value.

For single-value options like `command`, `working_dir` or `disabled`, the new value replaces the old value.

original process:

```yaml
processes:
  myprocess:
    # ...
    command: python app.py
```

local process:

```yaml
processes:
  myprocess:
    # ...
    command: python otherapp.py
```

result:

```yaml
processes:
  myprocess:
    # ...
    command: python otherapp.py
```

For the **multi-value options** `environment`, `depends_on`, `process-compose` merges entries together with locally-defined values taking precedence:

original process:

```yaml
processes:
  myprocess:
    # ...
    environment:
      - "A=3"
      - "C=8"
```

local process:

```yaml
processes:
  myprocess:
    # ...
    environment:
      - "A=4"
      - "B=5"
```

result:

```yaml
processes:
  myprocess:
    # ...
    environment:
      - "A=4"
      - "B=5"
      - "C=8"
```

### Configuration Inheritance with `extends`

`process-compose` provides the `extends` keyword to simplify configuration file inheritance:

```yaml
# ./some/dir/process-compose.prod.yaml
version: "0.5"
extends: "process-compose.yaml"

processes:
```

```yaml
# ./some/dir/process-compose.yaml
version: "0.5"

processes:
```

This is equivalent to running:

```shell
$ process-compose -f ./some/dir/process-compose.yaml -f ./some/dir/process-compose.prod.yaml
```

And allows you to use the shorter command:

```shell
$ process-compose -f ./some/dir/process-compose.prod.yaml
```

With the same result.

**Notes**:

1. Inheritance chains are limited only by available memory.
2. Circular inheritance will cause loading to fail.
3. The `extends` path is relative to the extending file's location (as shown in the example above).
4. Absolute paths are automatically detected and used as-is.
5. The `.env` file is loaded only from the `CWD`. Additional env files can be specified using `--env` (`-e`).
6. If file `B` uses the `extends` keyword to extend file `A`, loading both with `process-compose up -f A -f B` will fail. Load only the last file in the chain with `process-compose -f B` instead.

## Controlling Process Enabled Status with `is_disabled`

### The Challenge: Overriding `disabled: false`

In `process-compose`, you can define processes in multiple configuration files (e.g., a base `process-compose.yaml` and an `override.yaml`). These files are merged to produce the final configuration.

A common scenario is wanting to disable a process by default in the base configuration and then enable it specifically in an override file. The natural way to attempt this would be:

**`base.yaml`:**

```yaml
processes:
  my_process:
    command: "echo 'running process'"
    disabled: true
```

**`override.yaml`:**

```yaml
processes:
  my_process:
    # Attempt to enable the process
    disabled: false
```

However, due to the underlying configuration merging library (`mergo`) and how Go handles boolean types, this approach has limitations. In Go, the "zero value" for a boolean is `false`. When merging, the library might struggle to distinguish between a `disabled` field that was explicitly set to `false` in the override file and a `disabled` field that was simply *not present* in the override file (which would also result in a `false` value after initialization). This ambiguity can lead to the override `disabled: false` not reliably enabling the process as intended.

### The Solution: Introducing `is_disabled` (string)

To provide a reliable way to enable or disable processes via overriding configuration files, we have introduced a new configuration option: `is_disabled`.

**Key characteristics of `is_disabled`:**

1. **Type:** It is a **string**, not a boolean.
2. **Values:** It accepts the string values `"true"` or `"false"`.
3. **Purpose:** It allows you to explicitly signal your intent to enable or disable a process during configuration merging, overcoming the boolean zero-value ambiguity.

### How to Use `is_disabled`

You can now use `is_disabled` in your override files to reliably control the process state:

**`base.yaml`:**

```yaml
processes:
  my_process:
    command: "echo 'running process'"
    # Can be disabled using either field in the base file
    disabled: true
    # or is_disabled: "true"
```

**`override.yaml` (to enable the process):**

```yaml
processes:
  my_process:
    # Use is_disabled as a string to reliably enable
    is_disabled: "false"
```

**`override.yaml` (to explicitly disable the process, if it wasn't already):**

```yaml
processes:
  my_process:
    # Use is_disabled as a string to reliably disable
    is_disabled: "true"
```

Because `"false"` is not the zero value for a string (which is `""`), the merging logic can clearly distinguish between an explicitly set `is_disabled: "false"` and an unset field.

### Relationship Between `disabled` and `is_disabled`

Both `disabled` (boolean) and `is_disabled` (string) can coexist, but `is_disabled` takes precedence:

1. **If `is_disabled` is set** (to either `"true"` or `"false"` in the final merged configuration): Its value determines whether the process is disabled or enabled. The value of the `disabled` field is ignored.
2. **If `is_disabled` is \*not\* set:** The value of the `disabled` boolean field determines the state. If `disabled` is also not set, the process defaults to being enabled (`disabled: false`).

**Recommendation:**

- For **standard configuration** within a single file or when not dealing with complex override scenarios to *enable* a process, you can continue using the boolean `disabled` field (`disabled: true` or `disabled: false`).
- When **using override files** specifically to *enable* a process that might be disabled in a base file, use `is_disabled: "false"` in the override file for guaranteed results.
- You can also use `is_disabled: "true"` in override files if you prefer consistency, although `disabled: true` generally works reliably for disabling.
